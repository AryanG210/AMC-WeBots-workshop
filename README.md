### AMC CV and WeBots Workshop

Welcome to the Computer Vision and WeBots workshop offered by Aero Modelling Club. For the following workkshops, we'll learn how a drone *sees*. And guys it's not just a camera, but a lot of hidden algorithms and concepts are required to make sense of the images that a drone gets from the camera.</br>
