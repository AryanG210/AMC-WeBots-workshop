## Introduction

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision, "computer_vision-Wikipedia") -

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions.

## Used Libraries/Packages

- **OpenCV** - OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- **PixelLib** - PixelLib is a library created for performing image and video segmentation using few lines of code.
- **CVLib** - A simple, high level, easy-to-use open source Computer Vision library for Python.
- **Dlib** - Dlib is a general purpose cross-platform software library written in the programming language C++.
- **PIL/Pillow** - Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats

## Usage

Computer vision allows the computer to perform the same kind of tasks as humans with the same efficiency. There are a two main task which are defined below:

- Object Classification - In the object classification, we train a model on a dataset of particular objects, and the model classifies new objects as belonging to one or more of your training categories.
- Object Identification - In the object identification, our model will identify a particular instance of an object - for example, parsing two faces in an image and tagging one as Virat Kohli and other one as Rohit Sharma.
